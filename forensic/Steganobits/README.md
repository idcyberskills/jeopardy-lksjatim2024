## Flag

```
LKSJATIM{n0t_3ven_LSB_th1s_is_just_r3placing_th3_2nd_index_0f_pixel_channels_lolsteg}
```

## Description
I made a new technique that will introduce you to a world of steganography. I think my implementation of the final image product can only be seen by the good eyes only!

Can you recover the FLAG from the image? I can provide you my `Python` script that transform and hides the secret data (FLAG) into the duck image ðŸ¦†

## Difficulty
easy

## Hints
* Hint 1: Are you familiar with pixels data?
* Hint 2: The flag is in binary, parse it and decode it to binary.
